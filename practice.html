	<b>Albert Einstein</b> (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/;
[4] German: [ˈalbɛɐ̯t ˈaɪnʃtaɪn] ( listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was 
a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars 
of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[1][5]:274 Einstein's work is also known for its 
influence on the philosophy of science.
[6][7] Einstein is best known in popular culture for his mass–
energy equivalence formula E = mc2
(which has been dubbed "the world's most famous 
equation").[8] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and 
especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[9] a pivotal step in the evolution 
of quantum theory.</p>
